## 📄 Document Processing

> The Gemini Document API enables sophisticated analysis of tax documents, a critical capability for our platform.

### Key Capabilities

The Gemini Document API offers several advanced capabilities particularly relevant to tax document processing:

- **Native PDF processing**: Direct handling of complex tax forms in PDF format
- **Document chunking**: Breaking down lengthy tax documents into manageable sections
- **Document understanding**: Comprehending structure, layout, and relationships in tax documents
- **Form extraction**: Identifying and extracting data from structured tax forms
- **Table handling**: Processing tabular data common in tax documents

### Implementation Strategy

```javascript
/**
 * Processes tax documents using Gemini Document API
 * @param {string} fileUrl - URL to the tax document
 * @param {string} documentType - Type of tax document
 * @returns {object} Structured tax document data
 */
async function processTaxDocument(fileUrl, documentType) {
  // Initialize document processing
  const documentProcessor = new DocumentProcessor();
  
  // Configure processing based on document type
  const processingConfig = getTaxDocumentConfig(documentType);
  
  // Process the document
  const processedDocument = await documentProcessor.processDocument(
    fileUrl,
    processingConfig
  );
  
  // Extract structured data based on document type
  return extractTaxData(processedDocument, documentType);
}

/**
 * Returns processing configuration based on tax document type
 * @param {string} documentType - Type of tax document
 * @returns {object} Document processing configuration
 */
function getTaxDocumentConfig(documentType) {
  const configs = {
    "Form 1120": {
      chunking: {
        maxChunkSize: 4000,
        overlapSize: 200
      },
      extractionConfig: {
        headerNames: ["Gross receipts or sales", "Returns and allowances", "Cost of goods sold"],
        sections: ["Income", "Deductions", "Tax and Payments"],
        tableTypes: ["Balance Sheet", "Cost of Goods Sold"]
      },
      processingOptions: {
        extractForms: true,
        extractTables: true,
        ocr: true
      }
    },
    // Other document types...
  };
  
  return configs[documentType] || DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_CONFIG;
}
```

### Form Extraction Enhancement

Form extraction is particularly valuable for tax documents that follow standardized layouts:

```javascript
/**
 * Extracts structured data from a tax form
 * @param {object} processedDocument - Processed document from Document API
 * @param {string} formType - Specific tax form type
 * @returns {object} Structured form data
 */
function extractTaxFormData(processedDocument, formType) {
  // Get form extraction schema
  const formSchema = getTaxFormSchema(formType);
  
  // Extract form fields using schema
  const extractedFields = {};
  
  for (const field of formSchema.fields) {
    const fieldData = processedDocument.extractField(
      field.identifier,
      field.extractionRules
    );
    
    // Apply field-specific validation and formatting
    extractedFields[field.name] = validateAndFormatField(
      fieldData,
      field.dataType,
      field.validationRules
    );
  }
  
  // Extract tabular data if present
  if (formSchema.tables) {
    extractedFields.tables = {};
    
    for (const table of formSchema.tables) {
      extractedFields.tables[table.name] = processedDocument.extractTable(
        table.identifier,
        table.structureRules
      );
    }
  }
  
  return extractedFields;
}
```

### Agent Integration

Our Document Agent will leverage these capabilities to:

1. **Intake and Process**: Accept tax documents in various formats
2. **Classify**: Automatically identify document types (W-2, 1099, 1120, etc.)
3. **Extract**: Pull relevant data points following form-specific rules
4. **Validate**: Verify data consistency and flag potential issues
5. **Summarize**: Generate human-readable summaries of document contents
6. **Link**: Connect extracted data with advisory context

This significantly enhances our platform's ability to understand client tax situations by automatically processing their documentation.

 */
async function processTaxAudioQuery(audioData) {
  // Initialize audio processing with tax-specific configuration
  const audioProcessor = new GeminiAudioProcessor({
    modelType: "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25",
    domainHints: ["finance", "taxation", "accounting"],
    specializedVocabulary: TAX_TERMINOLOGY
  });
  
  // Process audio to text with enhanced tax term recognition
  const transcription = await audioProcessor.transcribe(audioData);
  
  // Process the tax query
  const taxResponse = await getTaxAdvisory(transcription.text);
  
  // Generate audio response if requested
  let audioResponse = null;
  if (transcription.responseFormat === "audio") {
    audioResponse = await audioProcessor.generateSpeech(
      taxResponse.explanation,
      {
        voice: "professional",
        speed: 1.0,
        emphasis: {
          terms: extractImportantTaxTerms(taxResponse),
          level: "moderate"
        }
      }
    );
  }
  
  return {
    transcription: transcription.text,
    taxResponse,
    audioResponse
  };
}
```

### Meeting Transcription for Tax Advisory

```javascript
/**
 * Transcribes and analyzes tax advisory meetings
 * @param {string} meetingAudioUrl - URL to meeting recording
 * @returns {object} Transcription with tax insights
 */
async function processTaxAdvisoryMeeting(meetingAudioUrl) {
  // Process meeting audio
  const meetingProcessor = new GeminiMeetingProcessor();
  
  // Transcribe with speaker diarization
  const transcription = await meetingProcessor.transcribeMeeting(
    meetingAudioUrl,
    {
      diarization: true,
      speakerCount: 2, // Typically advisor and client
      domainContext: "tax advisory"
    }
  );
  
  // Extract key tax topics discussed
  const taxTopics = extractTaxTopics(transcription);
  
  // Identify action items
  const actionItems = extractTaxActionItems(transcription);
  
  // Generate meeting summary
  const summary = await generateTaxMeetingSummary(
    transcription,
    taxTopics,
    actionItems
  );
  
  return {
    transcription,
    taxTopics,
    actionItems,
    summary
  };
}
```

### Agent Integration

Our tax agents will be enhanced with audio capabilities:

1. **Voice Advisory**: Enable spoken tax consultations
2. **Mobile Accessibility**: Allow clients to receive tax advice on-the-go
3. **Meeting Documentation**: Capture and analyze client-advisor conversations

  };
  
  // Generate response with visible thinking
  const response = await googleAI.generateContent({
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25",
    systemInstruction: TAX_ADVISORY_WITH_REASONING_PROMPT,
    contents: [
      { 
        role: "user", 
        parts: [{ text: formatTaxQueryWithContext(taxQuery, context) }] 
      }
    ],
    generationConfig: {
      temperature: 0.2,
      thinking: thinkingConfig
    }
  });
  
  // Extract the reasoning chain and formatted response
  return {
    finalAdvice: extractTaxAdvice(response),
    reasoningChain: extractReasoningChain(response),
    alternativesConsidered: extractAlternatives(response),
    confidenceAssessment: extractConfidenceMetrics(response),
    taxCodeReferences: extractCitations(response)
  };
}
```

### Example Tax Reasoning Chain

```javascript
// Example structured reasoning for tax deduction question
const exampleReasoningChain = [
  {
    step: 1,
    reasoning: "Identifying the type of expense: Client is asking about home office expenses while working as an independent consultant.",
    taxPrinciple: "Expenses must be ordinary and necessary for the business to be deductible."
  },
  {
    step: 2,
    reasoning: "Determining if home office qualifies: The space is used regularly and exclusively for business, which is required by IRC § 280A.",
    taxPrinciple: "Regular and exclusive use test under IRC § 280A",
    confidence: 0.95
  },
  {
    step: 3,
    reasoning: "Considering deduction method options: Simplified ($5/sqft) vs. Regular (actual expenses).",
    alternatives: [
      {
        method: "Simplified",
        calculation: "300 sqft × $5 = $1,500 deduction",
        pros: "Simple, no depreciation recapture",
        cons: "May result in lower deduction than actual expenses"
      },
      {
        method: "Regular",
        calculation: "300/2000 home size = 15% of utilities, mortgage interest, etc.",
        pros: "Potentially larger deduction",
        cons: "Requires more documentation, depreciation recapture possible"
      }
    ],
    taxPrinciple: "Rev. Proc. 2013-13 for simplified method"
  },
  {
    step: 4,
    reasoning: "Calculating estimated deduction amounts based on provided information to compare approaches.",
    calculation: {
      simplified: 1500,
      regular: 3200
    },
    recommendation: "Regular method based on provided expense information",
    confidence: 0.87
  }
];
```

### Agent Integration
