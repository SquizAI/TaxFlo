|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Technical** | AI model accuracy insufficient for tax decisions | 5 | 3 | 15 | • Phased approach with human oversight<br>• Domain expert validation<br>• Continuous training and improvement |
| **Technical** | Integration with client systems too complex | 4 | 4 | 16 | • Standard connector library<br>• Flexible data ingestion<br>• Client-specific integration testing |
| **Market** | Slow adoption due to trust concerns | 4 | 3 | 12 | • Targeted beta program<br>• Clear case studies with ROI<br>• Strategic partnerships for credibility |
| **Financial** | Development costs exceed projections | 3 | 4 | 12 | • Phased development with checkpoints<br>• Regular budget reviews<br>• Prioritization framework |
| **Operational** | Unable to recruit specialized talent | 4 | 3 | 12 | • Competitive compensation<br>• Remote work options<br>• Industry partnerships |
| **Regulatory** | Changing regulations affect AI models | 5 | 4 | 20 | • Regulatory tracking system<br>• Agile model updating<br>• Conservative compliance approach |
